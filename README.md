# OpenAI-Assistant
This is a React Native mobile application that uses OpenAI's Codex API to generate text based on user prompts.

## Requirements
To run the app, you will need to have Node.js and Expo CLI installed.

## Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies
3. Run npx expo start to start the development server

Once the app is running, open Settings and enter your OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key from OpenAI's website.

## Limitations
At the moment, the app can only accept text input for prompts. Speech-to-text input is a planned feature for future versions of the app.
